## The Design Play Manifesto

Even if this approach blows up big, has books written about it, takes over the business world, and becomes so distorted beyond its original meaning that it makes Agile look well-represented and crystal clear by comparison -- and especially then -- there is only one thing the Design Play Manifesto is trying to say and teach: you design better when you're having fun.

That's it.

## Running a Design Play Meetup

The format works really well at an informal gathering. Follow these steps:

1. Get everyone in a room
2. Order food and drinks
3. Assign a design task to the group
4. Give the group time to work on the problem
5. Share what you came up with

It doesn't sound like much, and that's by design. Here are some design prompts we've used in the past:

* Design a door
* Design Justin Bieber's career
* Design a bathtub
* Design the worst possible car
* Design something that would make society healthier

A good way to get the group thinking is to ask about pain points with existing products. What bugs you about the doors in your office? What could work better in your bathtub?

Once the group starts talking, inertia kicks in. The group will come up with ideas. Let them talk. Let them explore. And then as the conversation starts to shift away from design and towards other topics, let it.

That's how a Design Play meetup works.
